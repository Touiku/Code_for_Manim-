Visualization refers to the use of visual representations, such as charts, graphs, maps,
diagrams, animations, and videos, to communicate information, data, or ideas in a more
accessible and understandable format. The goal of visualization is to present complex or
abstract concepts in a visual form, making it easier for people to grasp and interpret the
information. It allows individuals to see patterns, trends, and relationships that might not be
apparent in raw data or text. In scientific research, the primary medium for visualization is
video, so developing skills in documentary video is critical in the communication and
dissemination of engineering and research accomplishments.

In this work, I employed a visual approach to study the well-known paradox proposed by
Zeno: the Achilles and Tortoise paradox. Through the creation of videos, I not only explained
the origins of Zenoâ€™s paradox and its resolutions but also revealed the underlying
spacetime transformation principles embedded within the paradox.
